# Creating_Dynamic_Soft_Sensor_For_Mining
For our Advanced Data Analysis project, we were asked to develop a Dynamic soft sensor
for Silica content in a flotation plant. The model must be able to predict the outlet Silica
in the ore using dynamic models. We were tasked with investigating how the regression
coefficients change with time and, based on this analysis, using lagged variables and
reducing them to the minimum possible. The developed model had to be able to operate
online and adapt to the changing dynamics of the process in real-time, which meant some
constrictions applied to how recent the measured variables could be when performing an
outlet Silica content estimation
